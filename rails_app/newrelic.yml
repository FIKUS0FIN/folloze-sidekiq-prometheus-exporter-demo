  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and

    # Error collector is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn
    # it off. This feature is only available at the Professional and above
    # product levels.
    enabled: true

    # Rails Only - tells error collector whether or not to capture a
    # source snippet around the place of the error when errors are View
    # related.
    capture_source: true

    # To stop specific errors from reporting to New Relic, set this property
    # to comma-separated values.  Default is to ignore routing errors,
    # which are how 404's get triggered.

  transaction_tracer:
    enabled: true

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction
    # trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds
    # this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to
    # New Relic. Valid values are any float value, or (default) "apdex_f",
    # which will use the threshold for an dissatisfying Apdex
    # controller action - four times the Apdex T value.
    transaction_threshold: apdex_f

    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be
    # recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off" which sends no
    # SQL, "raw" which sends the SQL statement in its original form,
    # and "obfuscated", which strips out numeric and string literals.
    record_sql: obfuscated

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL
    # call. In other words, when SQL statements exceed this threshold,
    # then capture and send to New Relic the current stack trace. This is
    # helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from.

    local_decorating:
      # If `true`, the agent decorates logs with metadata to link to entities, hosts, traces, and spans.
      # This requires a log forwarder to send your log files to New Relic.
      # This should not be used when forwarding is enabled.
